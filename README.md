# Awesome Audio over IP [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome [Audio over IP](https://www.avid.com/resource-center/audio-over-ip-avb-and-dante-what-todays-music-producer-should-know) tools and resources.

In the professional audio sector, Audio over IP (AoIP) is about transmitting uncompressed, low-latency audio over an IP (layer 3) network. Popular examples of protocols are [Dante](https://audinate.com), [AES67](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES67) and [Ravenna](https://www.ravenna-network.com/).

This is list is WIP. The AoIP ecosystem is still growing, so there is rather sparse tooling available at the moment.
See [here]() for a wishlist and [here]() for an "awesome list webpage".
